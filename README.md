# Finland_Weather
API weather in Finland from Finnish meteorological institute


User Interface (UI):

The app will have a user-friendly interface where users can input their location or select it from a dropdown menu.
Users can also choose the date and time for which they want to view the weather forecast.
The UI will display weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) for the selected location and time.
Data Retrieval:

The app will fetch weather data from an external API such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI using HTTP requests.
Users can trigger the data retrieval process by clicking a "Fetch Data" button after entering their location and desired date/time.
XML Configuration:

The app will use XML files to store configuration settings such as API keys, default locations, and other parameters.
These XML files can be easily modified by users to customize the app's behavior without changing the source code.
Parsing XML:

The app will parse the XML configuration files using C#'s XML parsing libraries to extract the necessary settings and parameters.
This parsed data will be used to configure the app's behavior, such as API endpoint URLs, API keys, and default locations.
Weather Data Display:

Once the weather data is retrieved from the API, it will be parsed and displayed in the UI.
The app will use XML parsing techniques to extract relevant information from the API response and display it in a human-readable format in the UI.
